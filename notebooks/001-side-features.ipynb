       "      <td>[THE MOST ADVANCED SPACE COMBAT CAPITAL SHIP SIMULATOR. EVER. SERIOUSLY., Universal Combat which was first released in 2004, was the spiritual successor to the infamous Battlecruiser series of games which made its debut in 1996. Then heralded as the most advanced capital ship space combat game, Battlecruiser 3000AD, the first title in the series, set the resulting standard for high-end capital ship combat games. You not only had control over a massive armed carrier in a vast universe with space and planetary bodies, you also had complete control over the carrier's systems (weapons, navigation etc), support crafts (fighters, shuttles, vehicles) as well as an entire crew that moved around the ship doing various things (e.g. engaging in combat with intruders). When Universal Combat arrived, aside from new graphics technologies, it brought along with it a host of new features which were not present in the previous Battlecruiser titles. Such features included advanced fps controls which allowed you to not only deploy your carrier crew to planets, control them in combat etc, but it also allowed you to fight alongside them In 2007, Universal Combat Collectors Edition was released as the final title in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat IPs. In 2009, following the 2008 release of Galactic Command Echo Squad SE (we also refreshed this game in 2014 and released as a Steam exclusive) which had improved space and planetary engines, we again refreshed the UCCE game and released it as Universal Combat Collector's Edition v2.0. This ultimate space capital ship combat compendium spans over two decades and represents the evolution of hard core space combat sims. It contains all Commander scenarios from every game in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat series:, Universal Combat Special Edition (3000AD, Oct 2006), Universal Combat Special Edition (3000AD, Oct 2006), Universal Combat A World Apart (3000AD, Oct 2005), Universal Combat A World Apart (3000AD, Oct 2005), Universal Combat Gold (3000AD, Oct 2005), Universal Combat Gold (3000AD, Oct 2005), Universal Combat (Dreamcatcher Interactive, Feb 2004), Universal Combat (Dreamcatcher Interactive, Feb 2004), Battlecruiser Millennium Gold (Dreamcatcher Interactive, March 2003), Battlecruiser Millennium Gold (Dreamcatcher Interactive, March 2003), Battlecruiser Millennium (EB Games Exclusive, Nov 2001), Battlecruiser Millennium (EB Games Exclusive, Nov 2001), Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0 (Interplay, Dec 1998), Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0 (Interplay, Dec 1998), Battlecruiser 3000AD (Take2, Sept. 1996), Battlecruiser 3000AD (Take2, Sept. 1996), PRIMARY GAMEPLAY FEATURES, Here is a sampling of the game features, out of hundreds of things that you can do in the game; most of which you can must make up as you go along.

The keyboard commands map almost every single key on your keyboard. Yeah. Better go check your ink cartridges. Oh and paper, you will need lots of paper. There is also a web based online appendix which details everything you need to know about the world of these games., EXCLUSIVE TO THIS RELEASE, This release contains Instant Action and Advanced Campaign Mode scenarios featuring the primary Commander career. It also has the freeform roam scenarios in which you can go anywhere in the game galaxy and do anything (within the limits of the game) without any orders. You simply make your own adventure. Though we removed all the secondary scenarios (such as those that feature infantry and fighter combat missions) in order to focus on the primary concept of the original Battlecruiser game which was purely about capital ship combat, this Steam version also contains never before released variants of the Instant Action and Advanced Campaign Mode scenarios scripted to use different capital ships. For example, the original A World Apart campaign scenario played as a Commander, featured a Battlecruiser MK3 carrier in part 1 and a Nightstar carrier in part 2. Both of these are included, in addition to variants using the newer Engstrom class carrier; the same ship featured in the Line Of Defense MMO game currently out on Steam Early Access. You can view the changelog for this version. The exclusion of the infantry and fighter based scenarios doesn't mean that you cannot play in those roles.

In the sanctuary of Star Haven there rested a fabled treasure called the Star Rod, which had the power to grant all wishes. Using this wondrous Star Rod, the seven revered Star Spirits watched over our peaceful world carefully... very carefully. Then one day, a terrible thing happened... The evil King Bowser appeared in Star Haven and stole the Star Rod! Using its incredible power he quickly imprisoned the seven Star Spirits! Completely unaware of the trouble in far-off Star Haven, Mario was back home in the Mushroom Kingdom, eagerly reading a letter from Princess Peach. It was an invitation to a party at the castle! With much anticipation, he and his brother Luigi set off for the party, oblivious to the chaos that lay ahead... Bullets change to: Follow Mario on his journey through an RPG-style story to save the princess!, Amazon.com, Paper Mario, has a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree., Paper Mario, is the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing game, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, . Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasons, Paper Mario, with a little action/adventure flavor.

       "91317   [THE MOST ADVANCED SPACE COMBAT CAPITAL SHIP SIMULATOR. EVER. SERIOUSLY., Universal Combat which was first released in 2004, was the spiritual successor to the infamous Battlecruiser series of games which made its debut in 1996. Then heralded as the most advanced capital ship space combat game, Battlecruiser 3000AD, the first title in the series, set the resulting standard for high-end capital ship combat games. You not only had control over a massive armed carrier in a vast universe with space and planetary bodies, you also had complete control over the carrier's systems (weapons, navigation etc), support crafts (fighters, shuttles, vehicles) as well as an entire crew that moved around the ship doing various things (e.g. engaging in combat with intruders). When Universal Combat arrived, aside from new graphics technologies, it brought along with it a host of new features which were not present in the previous Battlecruiser titles. Such features included advanced fps controls which allowed you to not only deploy your carrier crew to planets, control them in combat etc, but it also allowed you to fight alongside them In 2007, Universal Combat Collectors Edition was released as the final title in the Battlecruiser and Universal Combat IPs. In 2009, following the 2008 release of Galactic Command Echo Squad SE (we also refreshed this game in 2014 and released as a Steam exclusive) which had improved space and planetary engines, we again refreshed the UCCE game and released it as Universal Combat Collector's Edition v2.0.

There is also a web based online appendix which details everything you need to know about the world of these games., EXCLUSIVE TO THIS RELEASE, This release contains Instant Action and Advanced Campaign Mode scenarios featuring the primary Commander career. It also has the freeform roam scenarios in which you can go anywhere in the game galaxy and do anything (within the limits of the game) without any orders. You simply make your own adventure. Though we removed all the secondary scenarios (such as those that feature infantry and fighter combat missions) in order to focus on the primary concept of the original Battlecruiser game which was purely about capital ship combat, this Steam version also contains never before released variants of the Instant Action and Advanced Campaign Mode scenarios scripted to use different capital ships. For example, the original A World Apart campaign scenario played as a Commander, featured a Battlecruiser MK3 carrier in part 1 and a Nightstar carrier in part 2. Both of these are included, in addition to variants using the newer Engstrom class carrier; the same ship featured in the Line Of Defense MMO game currently out on Steam Early Access. You can view the changelog for this version. The exclusion of the infantry and fighter based scenarios doesn't mean that you cannot play in those roles. You can still play in an infantry role and also fly fighters; but you will do so as the Commander and not as the limited marine or pilot careers., MULTIPLAYER, There is no multiplayer in this version of the game., System Requirements:, Supported OS: Windows 8 Windows 7 Windows Vista Windows XP, Supported OS: Windows 8 Windows 7 Windows Vista Windows XP, Processor: Intel or AMD Dual Core, Processor: Intel or AMD Dual Core, RAM: 2 GB, RAM: 2 GB, Hard Disk: 2 GB, Hard Disk: 2 GB, Video Card: Any DirectX card with 1GB or more RAM, Video Card: Any DirectX card with 1GB or more RAM, Additional Requirements: Joystick, XBox360 / Xbox One controllers supported., Additional Requirements: Joystick, XBox360 / Xbox One controllers supported.]   \n",

We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what’s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it’s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.  In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city’s technology and holds key information on all of the city’s residents.  You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city’s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more.

                          [Product description, Far, far away beyond the sky, way above the clouds, it's been said that there was a haven where the Stars lived. In the sanctuary of Star Haven there rested a fabled treasure called the Star Rod, which had the power to grant all wishes. Using this wondrous Star Rod, the seven revered Star Spirits watched over our peaceful world carefully... very carefully. Then one day, a terrible thing happened... The evil King Bowser appeared in Star Haven and stole the Star Rod! Using its incredible power he quickly imprisoned the seven Star Spirits! Completely unaware of the trouble in far-off Star Haven, Mario was back home in the Mushroom Kingdom, eagerly reading a letter from Princess Peach. It was an invitation to a party at the castle! With much anticipation, he and his brother Luigi set off for the party, oblivious to the chaos that lay ahead... Bullets change to: Follow Mario on his journey through an RPG-style story to save the princess!, Amazon.com, Paper Mario, has a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree., Paper Mario, is the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing game, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, . Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasons, Paper Mario, with a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.]   \n",
