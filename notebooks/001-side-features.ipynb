When he lied about his age and joined the Royal Air Force at age 17, John didn't know that the life expectancy of an RAF crewman flying over enemy territory was calculated in weeks, not years. After his plane exploded, he suddenly found himself riding a parachute down to German-occupied France—the sole survivor among his crewmates. In the pages of SHOT DOWN you'll experience what it was like to ride in a Lancaster bomber dodging searchlights, flak, and night fighters. And you'll know how it felt to look down the muzzle of an enemy's rifle and realize you were now a prisoner of war. John Curnow was as determined as anyone on earth to have and defend freedom. Time and again he escaped his captors. But after each escape he found himself held captive again. After the war, bad habits and a fast-paced life going nowhere held him. Then one day his arm seemed to be shackled. When his hand refused to turn off the quartet singing “Lift Up the Trumpet” on the radio, John began to find his way to true, enduring freedom at last.]</td>\n",

In the Bible, her life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis that are about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood--the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers--Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah--the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting,, The Red Tent, combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of biblical women's society.]</td>\n",
       "      <td>[Amazon.com Review, The red tent is the place where women gathered during their cycles of birthing, menses, and even illness. Like the conversations and mysteries held within this feminine tent, this sweeping piece of fiction offers an insider's look at the daily life of a biblical sorority of mothers and wives and their one and only daughter, Dinah. Told in the voice of Jacob's daughter Dinah (who only received a glimpse of recognition in the Book of Genesis), we are privy to the fascinating feminine characters who bled within the red tent. In a confiding and poetic voice, Dinah whispers stories of her four mothers, Rachel, Leah, Zilpah, and Bilhah--all wives to Jacob, and each one embodying unique feminine traits. As she reveals these sensual and emotionally charged stories we learn of birthing miracles, slaves, artisans, household gods, and sisterhood secrets. Eventually Dinah delves into her own saga of betrayals, grief, and a call to midwifery., \"Like any sisters who live together and share a husband, my mother and aunties spun a sticky web of loyalties and grudges,\" Anita Diamant writes in the voice of Dinah. \"They traded secrets like bracelets, and these were handed down to me the only surviving girl. They told me things I was too young to hear. They held my face between their hands and made me swear to remember.\" Remembering women's earthy stories and passionate history is indeed the theme of this magnificent book. In fact, it's been said that, The Red Tent, is what the Bible might have been had it been written by God's daughters, instead of her sons., --Gail Hudson, Review, \"Diamant vividly conjures up the ancient world of caravans, shepherds, farmers, midwives, slaves, and artisans . . . her Dinah is a compelling narrator that has timeless resonance.\"—Merle Rubin,, Christian Science Monitor, \"An intense, vivid novel . . . It is tempting to say that, The Red Tent, is what the Bible would be like if it had been written by women, but only Diamant could have given it such sweep and grace.\", —The Boston Globe, \"The best fiction reporters create a world and bathe us in its sounds and sights, its language and climate, the intricate relationships among its inhabitants. Anita Diamant has performed this wondrous craft: She has brought forth one of those books that appear effortless precisely because the writer has pondered even the length of breath between each character's words . . . This earthy, passionate tale, told also with great delicacy, is, quite simply, a great read.\"—Jane Redmont,, National Catholic Reporter, \"By giving a voice to Dinah, one of the silent female characters in Genesis, the novel has struck a chord with women who may have felt left out of biblical history. It celebrates mothers and daughters and the mysteries of the life cycle.\", —The Los Angeles Times, \"A richly imagined world . . . Paints a vivid picture of what women's society might have resembled during biblical times. Although it is a novel, it is also an extended, midrash, or exegesis—filling in gaps left by the biblical text.\", —Jewish Times, \"[A] vivid evocation of the world of Old Testament women . . . The red tent becomes a symbol of womanly strength, love, and wisdom . . . Diamant succeeds admirably in depicting the lives of women in the age that engendered our civilization and our most enduring values.\", —Publishers Weekly, \"The oldest story of all could never seem more original, more true.\"—James Carroll, author of, An American Requiem, About the Author, Anita Diamant is an award-winning journalist and author of five books about contemporary Jewish life including, The New Jewish Wedding, and, Choosing a Jewish Life: Guidebook for People Converting to Judaism and for their Family and Friends, . She lives in Newton, Massachusetts, with her husband and daughter., Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved., THE RED TENT (Chapter 1), Their stories began with the day that my father appeared. Rachel came running into camp, knees flying, bellowing like a calf separated from its mother. But before anyone could scold her for acting like a wild boy, she launched into a breathless yarn about a stranger at the well, her words spilling out like water into sand., A wild man without sandals. Matted hair. Dirty face. He kissed her on the mouth, a cousin, son of their aunt, who had watered sheep and goats for her and told off the ruffians at the well., \"What are you babbling?\" demanded her father, Laban. \"Who is come to the well? Who attends him? How many bags does he carry?\", \"He is going to marry me,\" said Rachel matter-of-factly, once she had caught her breath. \"He says I am for him and that he would marry me tomorrow, if he could. He's coming to ask you.\", Leah scowled at this announcement. \"Marry you?\" she said, crossing her arms and throwing back her shoulders. \"You won't be marriageable for another year,\" said the older girl, who, though only a few years older than Rachel, already acted as head woman of her father's small holdings. The fourteen-year-old mistress of Laban's house liked to take a haughty, maternal tone with her sister. \"What's all this? And how did he come to kiss you?\" This was a terrible breach of custom--even if he was a cousin and even though Rachel was young enough to be treated as a child., Rachel stuck out her lower lip in a pout that would have been childlike only a few hours earlier. Something had happened since she opened her eyes that morning, when the most pressing matter on her mind had been to find the place where Leah hid her honey. Leah, that donkey, would never share it with her, but hoarded it for guests, giving tastes to pathetic little Bilhah and no one else., All Rachel could think of now was the shaggy stranger whose eyes had met hers with a shock of recognition that had rattled her to the bone., Rachel knew what Leah meant, but the fact that she had not yet begun to bleed meant nothing to her now. And her cheeks burned., \"What's this?\" said Leah, suddenly amused. \"She is smitten. Look at her,\" she said. \"Have you ever seen the girl blush before?\", \"What did he do to you?\" asked Laban, growling like a dog who senses an intruder near his herd. He clenched his fists and beetled his brow and turned his full attention to Rachel, the daughter he had never once hit, the daughter whom he rarely looked at full in the face. She had frightened him from her birth--a tearing, violent entry that had killed her mother. When the baby finally emerged, the women were shocked to see that it was such a small one--a girl at that--who had caused so many days of trouble, costing her mother so much blood and finally her life., Rachel's presence was powerful as the moon, and just as beautiful. Nobody could deny her beauty. Even as a child who worshiped my own mother's face, I knew that Leah's beauty paled before her younger sister's, a knowledge that always made me feel like a traitor. Still, denying it would have been like denying the sun's warmth., Rachel's beauty was rare and arresting. Her brown hair shaded to bronze, and her skin was golden, honeyed, perfect. In that amber setting, her eyes were surprisingly dark, not merely dark brown but black as polished obsidian or the depth of a well. Although she was small-boned and, even when she was with child, small-breasted, she had muscular hands and a husky voice that seemed to belong to a much larger woman., I once heard two shepherds arguing over which was Rachel's best feature, a game I, too, had played. For me, the most wonderful detail of Rachel's perfection was her cheeks, which were high and tight on her face, like figs. When I was a baby, I used to reach for them, trying to pluck the fruit that appeared when she smiled. When I realized there was no having them, I licked her instead, hoping for a taste. This made my beautiful aunt laugh, from deep in her belly. She loved me better than all her nephews put together--or so she said as she wove my hair into the elaborate braids for which my own mother's hands lacked patience or time., It is almost impossible to exaggerate the dimensions of Rachel's beauty. Even as a baby, she was a jewel upon whatever hip bore her from place to place, an ornament, a rare pleasure--the black-eyed child with golden hair. Her nickname was Tuki, which means \"sweetness.\", All the women shared in Rachel's care after her mother, Huna, died. Huna was a skilled midwife known for her throaty laugh and much mourned by the women. No one grumbled about tending to Huna's motherless daughter, and even the men, for whom babies held as little fascination as cooking stones, would stoop to run a callused hand across her remarkable cheek. They would rise, smelling their fingers and shaking their heads., Rachel smelled like water. Really! Wherever my aunt walked, there was the scent of fresh water. It was an impossible smell, green and delightful and in those dusty hills the smell of life and wealth. Indeed, for many years Laban's well was the only reason his family hadn't starved., There were hopes, early on, that Rachel would be a water witch, one who could find hidden wells and underground streams. She did not fulfill that hope, but somehow the aroma of sweet water clung to her skin and lodged in her robes. Whenever one of the babies went missing, more often than not the little stinker would be found fast asleep on her blankets, sucking his thumb., No wonder Jacob was enchanted at the well. The other men had grown accustomed to Rachel's looks and even to her startling perfume, but to Jacob she must have seemed an apparition. He looked directly into her eyes and was overcome. When he kissed her, Jacob cried out with a voice of a man who lies with his wife. The sound woke Rachel out of her childhood., There was barely time to hear Rachel describe their meeting before Jacob himself appeared. He walked up to Laban, and Rachel watched her father take his measure., Laban noticed his empty hands first, but he also saw that the stranger's tunic and cloak were made of fine stuff, his water skin was well crafted, his knife hilt was carved of polished bone. Jacob stood directly before Laban and, dropping his head, proclaimed himself. \"Uncle, I am the son of Rebecca, your sister, the daughter of Nahor and Milcah, as you are their son. My mother has sent me to you, my brother has chased me to you, my father has banished me to you. I will tell you the whole story when I am not so dirty and weary. I seek your hospitality, which is famous in the land.\", Rachel opened her mouth to speak, but Leah yanked her sister's arm and shot her a warning glance; not even Rachel's youth would excuse a girl speaking out when men were addressing one another. Rachel kicked at the ground and thought poisonous thoughts about her sister, the bossy old crow, the cross-eyed goat., Jacob's words about Laban's famous hospitality were a courteous lie, for Laban was anything but pleased by the appearance of this nephew. Not much caused the old man pleasure, and hungry strangers were unwanted surprises. Still, there was nothing to be done; he had to honor the claim of a kinsman, and there was no denying the connection between them. Jacob knew the names and Laban recognized his sister's face on the man standing before him., \"You are welcome,\" Laban said, without smiling or returning his nephew's salute. As he turned to walk away, Laban pointed his thumb at Leah, assigning her the task of seeing to this nuisance. My mother nodded and turned to face the first grown man who did not look away when confronted by the sight of her eyes., Leah's vision was perfect. According to one of the more ridiculous fables embroidered around my family's history, she ruined her eyes by crying a river of tears over the prospect of marrying my uncle Esau. If you believe that, you might also be interested in purchasing a magical toad that will make all who look upon you swoon with love., But my mother's eyes were not weak, or sick, or rheumy. The truth is, her eyes made others weak and most people looked away rather than face them--one blue as lapis, the other green as Egyptian grass., When she was born, the midwife cried out that a witch had been brought forth and should be drowned before she could bring a curse on the family. But my grandmother Adah slapped the stupid woman and cursed her tongue. \"Show me my daughter,\" said Adah, in a voice so loud and proud even the men outside could hear her. Adah named her beloved last-born Leah, which means \"mistress,\" and she wept a prayer that this child would live, for she had buried seven sons and daughters., There were plenty who remained convinced that the baby was a devil. For some reason, Laban, who was the most superstitious soul you can imagine (spitting and bowing whenever he turned to the left, howling at every lunar eclipse), refused to hear suggestions that Leah be left outside to die in the night air. He swore some mild oath about the femaleness of this child, but apart from that, Laban ignored his daughter and never mentioned her distinction. Then again, the women suspected the old man could not see color at all., Leah's eyes never faded in color--as some of the women predicted and hoped--but became brighter in their difference and even more pronounced in their strangeness when her lashes failed to grow. Although she blinked like everyone else, the reflex was nearly invisible, so it seemed that Leah never closed her eyes. Even her most loving glance felt a bit like the stare of a snake, and few could stand to look her straight in the eye. Those who could were rewarded with kisses and laughter and bread wet with honey., Jacob met Leah's eyes straight on, and for this she warmed to him instantly. In fact, Leah had already taken note of Jacob on account of his height. She was half a head taller than most of the men she had ever seen, and she dismissed them all because of it. She knew this was not fair. Surely there were good men among those whose heads reached only to her nose. But the thought of lying with anyone whose legs were shorter and weaker than her own disgusted her. Not that anyone had asked for her. She knew they all called her Lizard and Evil-Eye, and worse., Her distaste for short men had been confirmed by a dream in which a tall man had whispered to her. She couldn't recall his words, but they had warmed her thighs and woken her. When she saw Jacob, she remembered the dream and her strange eyes widened., Jacob noticed Leah with favor, too. Although he was still ringing from his encounter with Rachel, he could not ignore the sight of Leah., She was not only tall but shapely and strong. She was blessed with full, high breasts and muscular calves that showed to good advantage in robes that somehow never stayed closed at the hem. She had forearms like a young man's, but her walk was that of a woman with promising hips., Leah had dreamed once of a pomegranate split open to reveal eight red seeds. Zilpah said the dream meant she would have eight healthy children, and my mother knew those words to be true the way she knew how to make bread and beer., Leah's scent was no mystery. She smelled of the yeast she handled daily, brewing and baking. She reeked of bread and comfort, and--it seemed to Jacob--of sex. He stared at this giantess, and his mouth watered. As far as I know, he never said a word about her eyes., My aunt Zilpah, Laban's second-born, said that she remembered everything that ever happened to her. She laid claim to memories of her own birth, and even of days in her mother's womb. She swore she could remember her mother's death in the red tent, where she sickened within days after Zilpah arrived in the world, feet first. Leah scoffed at these claims, though not to her sister's face, for Zilpah was the only one who could cause my mother to hold her tongue about anything., Zilpah's memory of Jacob's arrival is nothing like Rachel's or Leah's, but then Zilpah had little use for men, whom she described as hairy, crude, and half human. Women needed men to make babies and to move heavy objects, but otherwise she didn't understand their purpose, much less appreciate their charms. She loved her sons passionately until they grew beards, but after that could barely bring herself to look at them., When I was old enough to ask what it was like on the day that my father arrived, she said that the presence of El hovered over him, which is why he was worthy of notice. Zilpah told me that El was the god of thunder, high places, and awful sacrifice. El could demand that a father cut off his son--cast him out into the desert, or slaughter him outright. This was a hard, strange god, alien and cold, but, she conceded, a consort powerful enough for the Queen of Heaven, whom she loved in every shape and name., Zilpah talked about gods and goddesses almost more than she spoke about people. I found this tiresome at times, but she used words in the most wonderful ways, and I loved her stories about Ninhursag, the great mother, and Enlil, the first father. She made up grandiose hymns in which real people met with the deities and together they danced to the sound of flutes and cymbals, singing them in a high, thin voice to the accompaniment of a small clay drum., From the age of her first blood, Zilpah thought of herself as a kind of priestess, the keeper of the mysteries of the red tent, the daughter of Asherah, the sister-Siduri who counsels women. It was a foolish idea, as only priests served the goddesses of the great city temples, while the priestesses served gods. Besides, Zilpah had none of the oracle's gifts. She lacked the talent for herbs, and could not prophesy or conjure or read goat entrails. Leah's eight-seeded pomegranate was the only dream she ever interpreted correctly., Zilpah was Laban's daughter by a slave named Mer-Nefat, who had been purchased from an Egyptian trader in the days when Laban still had means. According to Adah, Zilpah's mother was slender, raven-haired, and so quiet it was easy to forget she had the power of speech, a trait her daughter did not inherit., Zilpah was only a few months younger than Leah, and after Zilpah's mother died, Adah gave them suck together. They were playmates as babies, close and loving friends as children, tending the flocks together, gathering berries, making up songs, laughing. Apart from Adah, they needed no one else in the world., Zilpah was almost as tall as Leah, but thinner and less robust in the chest and legs. Dark-haired and olive-skinned, Leah and Zilpah resembled their father and shared the family nose, not unlike Jacob's--a regal hawk's beak that seemed to grow longer when they smiled. Leah and Zilpah both talked with their hands, thumb and forefinger pressed together in emphatic ovals. When the sun made them squint, identical lines appeared around the corners of their eyes., But where Leah's hair was curly, Zilpah's black mane was straight, and she wore it to her waist. It was her best feature, and my aunt hated to cover it. Headdresses caused her head to pound, she said, putting a hand to her cheek with silly drama. Even as a child I was permitted to laugh at her. These headaches were the reason she gave for keeping so much inside the women's tents. She did not join the rest of us to bask in the springtime sun or find the breeze on a hot night. But when the moon was young-slender and shy, barely making herself known in the sky--Zilpah walked around the camp, swinging her long hair, clapping her hands, offering songs to encourage the moon's return., When Jacob arrived, Bilhah was a child of eight, and she remembered nothing of the day. \"She was probably up in a tree somewhere, sucking on her fingers and counting the clouds,\" said Leah, repeating the only thing that was remembered of Bilhah's early years., Bilhah was the family orphan. The last daughter born of Laban's seed, she was the child of a slave named Tefnut--a tiny black woman who ran off one night when Bilhah was old enough to know she had been abandoned. \"She never got over that hurt,\" said Zilpah with great gentleness, for Zilpah respected pain., Bilhah was alone among them. It's not just that she was the youngest and that there were three other sisters to share the work. Bilhah was a sad child and it was easier to leave her alone. She rarely smiled and hardly spoke. Not even my grandmother Adah, who adored little girls and gathered motherless Zilpah to her inner circle and doted upon Rachel, could warm to this strange, lonely bird, who never grew taller than a boy of ten years, and whose skin was the color of dark amber., Bilhah was not beautiful like Rachel, or capable like Leah, or quick like Zilpah. She was tiny, dark, and silent. Adah was exasperated by her hair, which was springy as moss and refused to obey her hands. Compared to the two other motherless girls, Bilhah was neglected dreadfully., Left to herself, she climbed trees and seemed to dream. From her perch, she studied the world, the patterns in the sky, the habits of animals and birds. She came to know the flocks as individuals, giving each animal a secret name to match its personality. One evening, she came in from the fields and whispered to Adah that a black dwarf she-goat was ready to give birth to twins. It was nowhere near the season for goats to bear, and that particular animal had been barren for four seasons. Adah shook her head at Bilhah's nonsense and shooed her away., The next day, Laban brought news of a strange event in the flocks, with a precise retelling of the little girl's prediction. Adah turned to the girl and apologized. \"Bilhah sees clearly,\" said Adah to the other daughters, who turned to stare at this unseen sister and noticed, for the first time, the kindness in her black eyes., If you took the time to look, you could see right away that Bilhah was good. She was good the way milk is good, the way rain is good. Bilhah watched the skies and the animals, and she watched her family, too. From the dark corners of the tents, she saw Leah hide her mortification when people stared. Bilhah noticed Rachel's fear of the dark and Zilpah's insomnia. Bilhah knew that Laban was every bit as mean-spirited as he was stupid., Bilhah says her first clear memory of Jacob is from the day his first child was born. It was a boy--Reuben--and of course Jacob was delighted. He took his new son in his arms and danced the baby around and around outside the red tent., \"He was so gentle with the boy,\" Bilhah said. \"He would not let Adah take Reuben away from him, even when the little one began to wail., \"He called his son perfect and a miracle in the world. I stood beside him and together Jacob and I worshiped the baby. We counted his fingers and stroked the soft crown of his head. We delighted in him and in each other's joy,\" Bilhah said. \"That is when I met Jacob, your father.\", Jacob arrived late in the afternoon in the week of a full moon, ate a simple meal of barley bread and olives, and fell into an exhausted sleep that lasted through most of the next day. Leah was mortified by the simplicity of the food they had offered him at first, so the next day she set out to produce a feast seen only at the great festivals., \"I suffered over that meal like nothing else I had ever cooked,\" said Leah, telling me the story during dull, hot afternoons while we rocked the narrow-necked jars, straining the water from goat curd., \"The father of my children was in the house, I was sure of it. I could see he was smitten by Rachel, whose beauty I saw as if for the first time. Still, he looked at me without flinching, and so I hoped., \"I slaughtered a kid, an unblemished male, as though it were a sacrifice to the gods. I beat the millet until it was as soft as a cloud. I reached deep into the pouches where I kept my most precious spices and used the last of my dried pomegranate. I pounded, chopped, and scraped in a frenzy, believing that he would understand what I was offering him., \"Nobody helped me with the cooking, not that I would have permitted anyone else to touch the lamb or the bread, or even the barley water. I wouldn't let my own mother pour water into a pot,\" she said and giggled., I loved this story and asked to hear it again and again. Leah was always reliable and deliberate, and far too steady to be giddy. And yet as she recounted her first meal for Jacob, she was a foolish, weepy girl., \"I was an idiot,\" she said. \"I burned the first bread and burst into tears. I even sacrificed a bit of the next loaf so that Jacob might fancy me. Just as we do when we bake the cakes for the Queen of Heaven on the seventh day, I broke off a piece of dough, kissed it, and offered it to the fire as an offering of hope that the man would claim me., \"Don't ever tell Zilpah about this or I'll never hear the end of it,\" said Leah, in a mock-conspiratorial whisper. \"And of course, if Laban, your grandfather, had any idea of how much food I put together for a beggar who showed up without so much as a jug of oil as a gift, he would have flogged me. But I gave the old man enough strong beer that he made no comment., \"Or maybe he made no mention of my extravagance because he knew he'd be lucky with this kinsman. Maybe he guessed he had discovered a son-in-law who would require little by way of a dowry. It was hard to know what the old man knew or didn't know. He was like an ox, your grandfather.\", \"Like a post,\" I said., \"Like a cooking stone,\" said my mother., \"Like a goat turd,\" I said., My mother shook her finger at me as though I were a naughty child, but then she laughed out loud, for raking Laban over the coals was great sport among his daughters., I can still recite her menu. Lamb flavored with coriander, marinated in sour goat milk and a pomegranate sauce for dipping. Two kinds of bread: flat barley and raised wheat. Quince compote, and figs stewed with mulberries, fresh dates. Olives, of course. And to drink, a choice of sweet wine, three different beers, and barley water., ...]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[By the onset of her fifties, Patricia Smith Wood, author of the Harriet McKinsey murder mysteries, began to think about the amazing life of her mother, Ruby Ellen Scott Smith. Ruby had overcome a great deal of trauma and unhappiness in her early years. She worked hard to create a good life for herself. She loved to read, and had a vast library to prove it. Music warmed her soul. She was a prolific gardener. She also had a love of birds and maintained feeding stations for all of them well into her 90s., One of her favorite birds was the Cardinal. She'd seen them all her life in Texas and Maryland. When she moved to an area of New Mexico that didn't have cardinals, she started receiving Cardinal-themed gifts from her friends. They gave her refrigerator magnets, coasters, napkins, earrings-all featuring Cardinals., Not long after she died, her daughter Patricia began to received mental \"suggestions\" to write a book about her mother's life. At first, she dismissed the idea. Then one day my mind started exploring the possibility. I'm a fiction writer, she told herself. And she was very good at that, having won many awards, her favorite probably being the New Mexico Book of the Year Award., But the thought of a biography would not go away, and she began to realize that a book about Ruby's life and the historic events happening in those years might help 21st century people understand what 19th and 20th century people endured all those many years ago., When she finally began writing the biography, she started catalogs containing Cardinal-themed items. Coincidence?, She didn't think so. During the years before her mother died, Pat was a catalog junkie, but she never received any with cardinal themes., But after her mother passed, an eruption of catalogs appeared in Pat's mailbox. Almost every other page featured clothing, towels, pillows, and decorative items with Cardinals on them. There was, jewelry, tablecloths, Christmas tree ornaments. It became a running joke every mail delivery., One day, her husband Don said, \"Your mother is sending you a message to get back to work on her book.\" So she took his advice and went back to work., The catalogues still come. Pat feels sure her mother is gleefully laughing. Now that Raising Ruby is finished, she prays the catalog onslaught will stop.]</td>\n",

When he lied about his age and joined the Royal Air Force at age 17, John didn't know that the life expectancy of an RAF crewman flying over enemy territory was calculated in weeks, not years. After his plane exploded, he suddenly found himself riding a parachute down to German-occupied France—the sole survivor among his crewmates. In the pages of SHOT DOWN you'll experience what it was like to ride in a Lancaster bomber dodging searchlights, flak, and night fighters. And you'll know how it felt to look down the muzzle of an enemy's rifle and realize you were now a prisoner of war. John Curnow was as determined as anyone on earth to have and defend freedom. Time and again he escaped his captors. But after each escape he found himself held captive again. After the war, bad habits and a fast-paced life going nowhere held him. Then one day his arm seemed to be shackled. When his hand refused to turn off the quartet singing “Lift Up the Trumpet” on the radio, John began to find his way to true, enduring freedom at last.]   \n",

In the Bible, her life is only hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the more familiar chapters of the Book of Genesis that are about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. Told in Dinah's voice, this novel reveals the traditions and turmoils of ancient womanhood--the world of the red tent. It begins with the story of her mothers--Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah--the four wives of Jacob. They love Dinah and give her gifts that sustain her through a hard-working youth, a calling to midwifery, and a new home in a foreign land. Dinah's story reaches out from a remarkable period of early history and creates an intimate connection with the past. Deeply affecting,, The Red Tent, combines rich storytelling with a valuable achievement in modern fiction: a new view of biblical women's society.]   \n",

Ruby had overcome a great deal of trauma and unhappiness in her early years. She worked hard to create a good life for herself. She loved to read, and had a vast library to prove it. Music warmed her soul. She was a prolific gardener. She also had a love of birds and maintained feeding stations for all of them well into her 90s., One of her favorite birds was the Cardinal. She'd seen them all her life in Texas and Maryland. When she moved to an area of New Mexico that didn't have cardinals, she started receiving Cardinal-themed gifts from her friends. They gave her refrigerator magnets, coasters, napkins, earrings-all featuring Cardinals., Not long after she died, her daughter Patricia began to received mental \"suggestions\" to write a book about her mother's life. At first, she dismissed the idea. Then one day my mind started exploring the possibility. I'm a fiction writer, she told herself. And she was very good at that, having won many awards, her favorite probably being the New Mexico Book of the Year Award., But the thought of a biography would not go away, and she began to realize that a book about Ruby's life and the historic events happening in those years might help 21st century people understand what 19th and 20th century people endured all those many years ago., When she finally began writing the biography, she started catalogs containing Cardinal-themed items. Coincidence?, She didn't think so. During the years before her mother died, Pat was a catalog junkie, but she never received any with cardinal themes., But after her mother passed, an eruption of catalogs appeared in Pat's mailbox. Almost every other page featured clothing, towels, pillows, and decorative items with Cardinals on them. There was, jewelry, tablecloths, Christmas tree ornaments. It became a running joke every mail delivery., One day, her husband Don said, \"Your mother is sending you a message to get back to work on her book.\" So she took his advice and went back to work., The catalogues still come. Pat feels sure her mother is gleefully laughing. Now that Raising Ruby is finished, she prays the catalog onslaught will stop.]   \n",

       "464204   [Amazon.com Review, The red tent is the place where women gathered during their cycles of birthing, menses, and even illness. Like the conversations and mysteries held within this feminine tent, this sweeping piece of fiction offers an insider's look at the daily life of a biblical sorority of mothers and wives and their one and only daughter, Dinah. Told in the voice of Jacob's daughter Dinah (who only received a glimpse of recognition in the Book of Genesis), we are privy to the fascinating feminine characters who bled within the red tent. In a confiding and poetic voice, Dinah whispers stories of her four mothers, Rachel, Leah, Zilpah, and Bilhah--all wives to Jacob, and each one embodying unique feminine traits. As she reveals these sensual and emotionally charged stories we learn of birthing miracles, slaves, artisans, household gods, and sisterhood secrets. Eventually Dinah delves into her own saga of betrayals, grief, and a call to midwifery., \"Like any sisters who live together and share a husband, my mother and aunties spun a sticky web of loyalties and grudges,\" Anita Diamant writes in the voice of Dinah. \"They traded secrets like bracelets, and these were handed down to me the only surviving girl. They told me things I was too young to hear. They held my face between their hands and made me swear to remember.\" Remembering women's earthy stories and passionate history is indeed the theme of this magnificent book. In fact, it's been said that, The Red Tent, is what the Bible might have been had it been written by God's daughters, instead of her sons., --Gail Hudson, Review, \"Diamant vividly conjures up the ancient world of caravans, shepherds, farmers, midwives, slaves, and artisans . . . her Dinah is a compelling narrator that has timeless resonance.\"—Merle Rubin,, Christian Science Monitor, \"An intense, vivid novel . . . It is tempting to say that, The Red Tent, is what the Bible would be like if it had been written by women, but only Diamant could have given it such sweep and grace.\", —The Boston Globe, \"The best fiction reporters create a world and bathe us in its sounds and sights, its language and climate, the intricate relationships among its inhabitants. Anita Diamant has performed this wondrous craft: She has brought forth one of those books that appear effortless precisely because the writer has pondered even the length of breath between each character's words . . . This earthy, passionate tale, told also with great delicacy, is, quite simply, a great read.\"—Jane Redmont,, National Catholic Reporter, \"By giving a voice to Dinah, one of the silent female characters in Genesis, the novel has struck a chord with women who may have felt left out of biblical history. It celebrates mothers and daughters and the mysteries of the life cycle.\", —The Los Angeles Times, \"A richly imagined world . . . Paints a vivid picture of what women's society might have resembled during biblical times. Although it is a novel, it is also an extended, midrash, or exegesis—filling in gaps left by the biblical text.\", —Jewish Times, \"[A] vivid evocation of the world of Old Testament women . . . The red tent becomes a symbol of womanly strength, love, and wisdom . . . Diamant succeeds admirably in depicting the lives of women in the age that engendered our civilization and our most enduring values.\", —Publishers Weekly, \"The oldest story of all could never seem more original, more true.\"—James Carroll, author of, An American Requiem, About the Author, Anita Diamant is an award-winning journalist and author of five books about contemporary Jewish life including, The New Jewish Wedding, and, Choosing a Jewish Life: Guidebook for People Converting to Judaism and for their Family and Friends, . She lives in Newton, Massachusetts, with her husband and daughter., Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved., THE RED TENT (Chapter 1), Their stories began with the day that my father appeared. Rachel came running into camp, knees flying, bellowing like a calf separated from its mother. But before anyone could scold her for acting like a wild boy, she launched into a breathless yarn about a stranger at the well, her words spilling out like water into sand., A wild man without sandals. Matted hair. Dirty face. He kissed her on the mouth, a cousin, son of their aunt, who had watered sheep and goats for her and told off the ruffians at the well., \"What are you babbling?\" demanded her father, Laban. \"Who is come to the well? Who attends him? How many bags does he carry?\", \"He is going to marry me,\" said Rachel matter-of-factly, once she had caught her breath. \"He says I am for him and that he would marry me tomorrow, if he could. He's coming to ask you.\", Leah scowled at this announcement. \"Marry you?\" she said, crossing her arms and throwing back her shoulders. \"You won't be marriageable for another year,\" said the older girl, who, though only a few years older than Rachel, already acted as head woman of her father's small holdings. The fourteen-year-old mistress of Laban's house liked to take a haughty, maternal tone with her sister. \"What's all this? And how did he come to kiss you?\" This was a terrible breach of custom--even if he was a cousin and even though Rachel was young enough to be treated as a child., Rachel stuck out her lower lip in a pout that would have been childlike only a few hours earlier. Something had happened since she opened her eyes that morning, when the most pressing matter on her mind had been to find the place where Leah hid her honey. Leah, that donkey, would never share it with her, but hoarded it for guests, giving tastes to pathetic little Bilhah and no one else., All Rachel could think of now was the shaggy stranger whose eyes had met hers with a shock of recognition that had rattled her to the bone., Rachel knew what Leah meant, but the fact that she had not yet begun to bleed meant nothing to her now. And her cheeks burned., \"What's this?\" said Leah, suddenly amused. \"She is smitten. Look at her,\" she said. \"Have you ever seen the girl blush before?\", \"What did he do to you?\" asked Laban, growling like a dog who senses an intruder near his herd. He clenched his fists and beetled his brow and turned his full attention to Rachel, the daughter he had never once hit, the daughter whom he rarely looked at full in the face. She had frightened him from her birth--a tearing, violent entry that had killed her mother. When the baby finally emerged, the women were shocked to see that it was such a small one--a girl at that--who had caused so many days of trouble, costing her mother so much blood and finally her life., Rachel's presence was powerful as the moon, and just as beautiful. Nobody could deny her beauty. Even as a child who worshiped my own mother's face, I knew that Leah's beauty paled before her younger sister's, a knowledge that always made me feel like a traitor. Still, denying it would have been like denying the sun's warmth., Rachel's beauty was rare and arresting. Her brown hair shaded to bronze, and her skin was golden, honeyed, perfect. In that amber setting, her eyes were surprisingly dark, not merely dark brown but black as polished obsidian or the depth of a well. Although she was small-boned and, even when she was with child, small-breasted, she had muscular hands and a husky voice that seemed to belong to a much larger woman., I once heard two shepherds arguing over which was Rachel's best feature, a game I, too, had played. For me, the most wonderful detail of Rachel's perfection was her cheeks, which were high and tight on her face, like figs. When I was a baby, I used to reach for them, trying to pluck the fruit that appeared when she smiled. When I realized there was no having them, I licked her instead, hoping for a taste. This made my beautiful aunt laugh, from deep in her belly. She loved me better than all her nephews put together--or so she said as she wove my hair into the elaborate braids for which my own mother's hands lacked patience or time., It is almost impossible to exaggerate the dimensions of Rachel's beauty. Even as a baby, she was a jewel upon whatever hip bore her from place to place, an ornament, a rare pleasure--the black-eyed child with golden hair. Her nickname was Tuki, which means \"sweetness.\", All the women shared in Rachel's care after her mother, Huna, died. Huna was a skilled midwife known for her throaty laugh and much mourned by the women. No one grumbled about tending to Huna's motherless daughter, and even the men, for whom babies held as little fascination as cooking stones, would stoop to run a callused hand across her remarkable cheek. They would rise, smelling their fingers and shaking their heads., Rachel smelled like water. Really! Wherever my aunt walked, there was the scent of fresh water. It was an impossible smell, green and delightful and in those dusty hills the smell of life and wealth. Indeed, for many years Laban's well was the only reason his family hadn't starved., There were hopes, early on, that Rachel would be a water witch, one who could find hidden wells and underground streams. She did not fulfill that hope, but somehow the aroma of sweet water clung to her skin and lodged in her robes. Whenever one of the babies went missing, more often than not the little stinker would be found fast asleep on her blankets, sucking his thumb., No wonder Jacob was enchanted at the well. The other men had grown accustomed to Rachel's looks and even to her startling perfume, but to Jacob she must have seemed an apparition. He looked directly into her eyes and was overcome. When he kissed her, Jacob cried out with a voice of a man who lies with his wife. The sound woke Rachel out of her childhood., There was barely time to hear Rachel describe their meeting before Jacob himself appeared. He walked up to Laban, and Rachel watched her father take his measure., Laban noticed his empty hands first, but he also saw that the stranger's tunic and cloak were made of fine stuff, his water skin was well crafted, his knife hilt was carved of polished bone. Jacob stood directly before Laban and, dropping his head, proclaimed himself. \"Uncle, I am the son of Rebecca, your sister, the daughter of Nahor and Milcah, as you are their son. My mother has sent me to you, my brother has chased me to you, my father has banished me to you. I will tell you the whole story when I am not so dirty and weary. I seek your hospitality, which is famous in the land.\", Rachel opened her mouth to speak, but Leah yanked her sister's arm and shot her a warning glance; not even Rachel's youth would excuse a girl speaking out when men were addressing one another. Rachel kicked at the ground and thought poisonous thoughts about her sister, the bossy old crow, the cross-eyed goat., Jacob's words about Laban's famous hospitality were a courteous lie, for Laban was anything but pleased by the appearance of this nephew. Not much caused the old man pleasure, and hungry strangers were unwanted surprises. Still, there was nothing to be done; he had to honor the claim of a kinsman, and there was no denying the connection between them. Jacob knew the names and Laban recognized his sister's face on the man standing before him., \"You are welcome,\" Laban said, without smiling or returning his nephew's salute. As he turned to walk away, Laban pointed his thumb at Leah, assigning her the task of seeing to this nuisance. My mother nodded and turned to face the first grown man who did not look away when confronted by the sight of her eyes., Leah's vision was perfect. According to one of the more ridiculous fables embroidered around my family's history, she ruined her eyes by crying a river of tears over the prospect of marrying my uncle Esau. If you believe that, you might also be interested in purchasing a magical toad that will make all who look upon you swoon with love., But my mother's eyes were not weak, or sick, or rheumy. The truth is, her eyes made others weak and most people looked away rather than face them--one blue as lapis, the other green as Egyptian grass., When she was born, the midwife cried out that a witch had been brought forth and should be drowned before she could bring a curse on the family. But my grandmother Adah slapped the stupid woman and cursed her tongue. \"Show me my daughter,\" said Adah, in a voice so loud and proud even the men outside could hear her. Adah named her beloved last-born Leah, which means \"mistress,\" and she wept a prayer that this child would live, for she had buried seven sons and daughters., There were plenty who remained convinced that the baby was a devil. For some reason, Laban, who was the most superstitious soul you can imagine (spitting and bowing whenever he turned to the left, howling at every lunar eclipse), refused to hear suggestions that Leah be left outside to die in the night air. He swore some mild oath about the femaleness of this child, but apart from that, Laban ignored his daughter and never mentioned her distinction. Then again, the women suspected the old man could not see color at all., Leah's eyes never faded in color--as some of the women predicted and hoped--but became brighter in their difference and even more pronounced in their strangeness when her lashes failed to grow. Although she blinked like everyone else, the reflex was nearly invisible, so it seemed that Leah never closed her eyes. Even her most loving glance felt a bit like the stare of a snake, and few could stand to look her straight in the eye. Those who could were rewarded with kisses and laughter and bread wet with honey., Jacob met Leah's eyes straight on, and for this she warmed to him instantly. In fact, Leah had already taken note of Jacob on account of his height. She was half a head taller than most of the men she had ever seen, and she dismissed them all because of it. She knew this was not fair. Surely there were good men among those whose heads reached only to her nose. But the thought of lying with anyone whose legs were shorter and weaker than her own disgusted her. Not that anyone had asked for her. She knew they all called her Lizard and Evil-Eye, and worse., Her distaste for short men had been confirmed by a dream in which a tall man had whispered to her. She couldn't recall his words, but they had warmed her thighs and woken her. When she saw Jacob, she remembered the dream and her strange eyes widened., Jacob noticed Leah with favor, too. Although he was still ringing from his encounter with Rachel, he could not ignore the sight of Leah., She was not only tall but shapely and strong. She was blessed with full, high breasts and muscular calves that showed to good advantage in robes that somehow never stayed closed at the hem. She had forearms like a young man's, but her walk was that of a woman with promising hips., Leah had dreamed once of a pomegranate split open to reveal eight red seeds. Zilpah said the dream meant she would have eight healthy children, and my mother knew those words to be true the way she knew how to make bread and beer., Leah's scent was no mystery. She smelled of the yeast she handled daily, brewing and baking. She reeked of bread and comfort, and--it seemed to Jacob--of sex. He stared at this giantess, and his mouth watered. As far as I know, he never said a word about her eyes., My aunt Zilpah, Laban's second-born, said that she remembered everything that ever happened to her. She laid claim to memories of her own birth, and even of days in her mother's womb. She swore she could remember her mother's death in the red tent, where she sickened within days after Zilpah arrived in the world, feet first. Leah scoffed at these claims, though not to her sister's face, for Zilpah was the only one who could cause my mother to hold her tongue about anything., Zilpah's memory of Jacob's arrival is nothing like Rachel's or Leah's, but then Zilpah had little use for men, whom she described as hairy, crude, and half human. Women needed men to make babies and to move heavy objects, but otherwise she didn't understand their purpose, much less appreciate their charms. She loved her sons passionately until they grew beards, but after that could barely bring herself to look at them., When I was old enough to ask what it was like on the day that my father arrived, she said that the presence of El hovered over him, which is why he was worthy of notice. Zilpah told me that El was the god of thunder, high places, and awful sacrifice. El could demand that a father cut off his son--cast him out into the desert, or slaughter him outright. This was a hard, strange god, alien and cold, but, she conceded, a consort powerful enough for the Queen of Heaven, whom she loved in every shape and name., Zilpah talked about gods and goddesses almost more than she spoke about people. I found this tiresome at times, but she used words in the most wonderful ways, and I loved her stories about Ninhursag, the great mother, and Enlil, the first father. She made up grandiose hymns in which real people met with the deities and together they danced to the sound of flutes and cymbals, singing them in a high, thin voice to the accompaniment of a small clay drum., From the age of her first blood, Zilpah thought of herself as a kind of priestess, the keeper of the mysteries of the red tent, the daughter of Asherah, the sister-Siduri who counsels women. It was a foolish idea, as only priests served the goddesses of the great city temples, while the priestesses served gods. Besides, Zilpah had none of the oracle's gifts. She lacked the talent for herbs, and could not prophesy or conjure or read goat entrails. Leah's eight-seeded pomegranate was the only dream she ever interpreted correctly., Zilpah was Laban's daughter by a slave named Mer-Nefat, who had been purchased from an Egyptian trader in the days when Laban still had means. According to Adah, Zilpah's mother was slender, raven-haired, and so quiet it was easy to forget she had the power of speech, a trait her daughter did not inherit., Zilpah was only a few months younger than Leah, and after Zilpah's mother died, Adah gave them suck together. They were playmates as babies, close and loving friends as children, tending the flocks together, gathering berries, making up songs, laughing. Apart from Adah, they needed no one else in the world., Zilpah was almost as tall as Leah, but thinner and less robust in the chest and legs. Dark-haired and olive-skinned, Leah and Zilpah resembled their father and shared the family nose, not unlike Jacob's--a regal hawk's beak that seemed to grow longer when they smiled. Leah and Zilpah both talked with their hands, thumb and forefinger pressed together in emphatic ovals. When the sun made them squint, identical lines appeared around the corners of their eyes., But where Leah's hair was curly, Zilpah's black mane was straight, and she wore it to her waist. It was her best feature, and my aunt hated to cover it. Headdresses caused her head to pound, she said, putting a hand to her cheek with silly drama. Even as a child I was permitted to laugh at her. These headaches were the reason she gave for keeping so much inside the women's tents. She did not join the rest of us to bask in the springtime sun or find the breeze on a hot night. But when the moon was young-slender and shy, barely making herself known in the sky--Zilpah walked around the camp, swinging her long hair, clapping her hands, offering songs to encourage the moon's return., When Jacob arrived, Bilhah was a child of eight, and she remembered nothing of the day. \"She was probably up in a tree somewhere, sucking on her fingers and counting the clouds,\" said Leah, repeating the only thing that was remembered of Bilhah's early years., Bilhah was the family orphan. The last daughter born of Laban's seed, she was the child of a slave named Tefnut--a tiny black woman who ran off one night when Bilhah was old enough to know she had been abandoned. \"She never got over that hurt,\" said Zilpah with great gentleness, for Zilpah respected pain., Bilhah was alone among them. It's not just that she was the youngest and that there were three other sisters to share the work. Bilhah was a sad child and it was easier to leave her alone. She rarely smiled and hardly spoke. Not even my grandmother Adah, who adored little girls and gathered motherless Zilpah to her inner circle and doted upon Rachel, could warm to this strange, lonely bird, who never grew taller than a boy of ten years, and whose skin was the color of dark amber., Bilhah was not beautiful like Rachel, or capable like Leah, or quick like Zilpah. She was tiny, dark, and silent. Adah was exasperated by her hair, which was springy as moss and refused to obey her hands. Compared to the two other motherless girls, Bilhah was neglected dreadfully., Left to herself, she climbed trees and seemed to dream. From her perch, she studied the world, the patterns in the sky, the habits of animals and birds. She came to know the flocks as individuals, giving each animal a secret name to match its personality. One evening, she came in from the fields and whispered to Adah that a black dwarf she-goat was ready to give birth to twins. It was nowhere near the season for goats to bear, and that particular animal had been barren for four seasons. Adah shook her head at Bilhah's nonsense and shooed her away., The next day, Laban brought news of a strange event in the flocks, with a precise retelling of the little girl's prediction. Adah turned to the girl and apologized. \"Bilhah sees clearly,\" said Adah to the other daughters, who turned to stare at this unseen sister and noticed, for the first time, the kindness in her black eyes., If you took the time to look, you could see right away that Bilhah was good. She was good the way milk is good, the way rain is good. Bilhah watched the skies and the animals, and she watched her family, too. From the dark corners of the tents, she saw Leah hide her mortification when people stared. Bilhah noticed Rachel's fear of the dark and Zilpah's insomnia. Bilhah knew that Laban was every bit as mean-spirited as he was stupid., Bilhah says her first clear memory of Jacob is from the day his first child was born. It was a boy--Reuben--and of course Jacob was delighted. He took his new son in his arms and danced the baby around and around outside the red tent., \"He was so gentle with the boy,\" Bilhah said. \"He would not let Adah take Reuben away from him, even when the little one began to wail., \"He called his son perfect and a miracle in the world. I stood beside him and together Jacob and I worshiped the baby. We counted his fingers and stroked the soft crown of his head. We delighted in him and in each other's joy,\" Bilhah said. \"That is when I met Jacob, your father.\", Jacob arrived late in the afternoon in the week of a full moon, ate a simple meal of barley bread and olives, and fell into an exhausted sleep that lasted through most of the next day. Leah was mortified by the simplicity of the food they had offered him at first, so the next day she set out to produce a feast seen only at the great festivals., \"I suffered over that meal like nothing else I had ever cooked,\" said Leah, telling me the story during dull, hot afternoons while we rocked the narrow-necked jars, straining the water from goat curd., \"The father of my children was in the house, I was sure of it. I could see he was smitten by Rachel, whose beauty I saw as if for the first time. Still, he looked at me without flinching, and so I hoped., \"I slaughtered a kid, an unblemished male, as though it were a sacrifice to the gods. I beat the millet until it was as soft as a cloud. I reached deep into the pouches where I kept my most precious spices and used the last of my dried pomegranate. I pounded, chopped, and scraped in a frenzy, believing that he would understand what I was offering him., \"Nobody helped me with the cooking, not that I would have permitted anyone else to touch the lamb or the bread, or even the barley water. I wouldn't let my own mother pour water into a pot,\" she said and giggled., I loved this story and asked to hear it again and again. Leah was always reliable and deliberate, and far too steady to be giddy. And yet as she recounted her first meal for Jacob, she was a foolish, weepy girl., \"I was an idiot,\" she said. \"I burned the first bread and burst into tears. I even sacrificed a bit of the next loaf so that Jacob might fancy me. Just as we do when we bake the cakes for the Queen of Heaven on the seventh day, I broke off a piece of dough, kissed it, and offered it to the fire as an offering of hope that the man would claim me., \"Don't ever tell Zilpah about this or I'll never hear the end of it,\" said Leah, in a mock-conspiratorial whisper. \"And of course, if Laban, your grandfather, had any idea of how much food I put together for a beggar who showed up without so much as a jug of oil as a gift, he would have flogged me. But I gave the old man enough strong beer that he made no comment., \"Or maybe he made no mention of my extravagance because he knew he'd be lucky with this kinsman. Maybe he guessed he had discovered a son-in-law who would require little by way of a dowry. It was hard to know what the old man knew or didn't know. He was like an ox, your grandfather.\", \"Like a post,\" I said., \"Like a cooking stone,\" said my mother., \"Like a goat turd,\" I said., My mother shook her finger at me as though I were a naughty child, but then she laughed out loud, for raking Laban over the coals was great sport among his daughters., I can still recite her menu. Lamb flavored with coriander, marinated in sour goat milk and a pomegranate sauce for dipping. Two kinds of bread: flat barley and raised wheat. Quince compote, and figs stewed with mulberries, fresh dates. Olives, of course. And to drink, a choice of sweet wine, three different beers, and barley water., ...]   \n",

tomorrow, the last reveries of a dying man. She burrows deeply into the sensibilities of recognizable, ordinary people―our younger selves, sisters and brothers we could know, parents and adult children we have been or have observed.―, Projo Arts Blog, Providence Journal, Exceptionally intense, intricately structured, and as arresting and consistently engaging as fractal art . . . the stories trace characters' sense of a double existence: the life inside family, defined and constrained by McGarry's meticulous details, and the boundless life of the spirit. Her literary progenitors range from Willa Cather to Virginia Woolf―but she brings a savage lyricism to her stories, a sense of rage contained perilously by wit and intelligence, that gives the stories a menacing aspect, like watching a man threatening suicide walk on a ledge.―, The Hopkins Review, Review, A gifted observer, records with fidelity the daily minutiae of life and introspection.―, Publishers Weekly, Ms. McGarry's stories have the feel of paintings by Edward Hopper. Her characters are solitudinous and lonely, rarely funny, but they often carry with them, even in their defeat, a certain dignity. She is a writer who honors the human condition.―, Baltimore Sun, McGarry's thickly layered prose, with its stunning emotional accuracies, is always just on the verge of exploding into dream or fantasy.―, Women's Review of Books, At her best, McGarry illuminates our quirky, flawed selves and neighbors, and makes us nod even as we sigh.―, Women's Review of Books, McGarry's prose is fresh, her plots unpredictable, and her dialogue shimmeringly wry . . . Reading McGarry's stories is to be surprised and delighted.―, Kirkus Reviews (starred review), Review, \"A gifted observer, records with fidelity the daily minutiae of life and introspection.\", \"Ms. McGarry's stories have the feel of paintings by Edward Hopper.

My new book, PERIOD. END OF SENTENCE, takes on women's bodies and freedom in an entirely different way.\", 'When the movie, Period. End of Sentence. won an Oscar in 2019, the film’s producer and founder of The Pad Project, Melissa Berton, told the audience: “A period should end a sentence, not a girl’s education.” Inspired by the documentary, I mya collection of essays describes the cultural roots of menstrual injustice and how it erodes self-esteem, limits opportunities and even threatens lives. But the also book celebrates a new generation of activists and innovators working to end period poverty and stigma, and also explores the emerging world of period products, advertising, activism art, and comedy.', \"When I was a child, the public library on Osborne Terrace in Newark, New Jersey, was one of the first places I was allowed to walk to all by myself. I went every week, and I can still draw a map of the children's room, up a flight of stairs,where the Louisa May Alcott books were arranged to the left as you entered.\", 'Nonfiction, near the middle of the room, was loaded with biographies. I read several about Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart, and Helen Keller, with whom I share a birthday.', \"But by the time I was 11, the children's library was starting to feel confining,so I snuck downstairs to the adult stacks for a copy of The Good Earth. (I had overheard a grown-up conversation about the book and it sounded interesting.)The librarian at the desk glanced at the title and said I wasn't old enough for the novel and furthermore my card only entitled me to take out children's books.\", 'I defended my choice. I said my parents had given me permission, which was only half a fib since my mother and father had never denied me any book. Eventually,the librarian relented and I walked home, triumphant.

Law enforcement is in her DNA. Her father served as a police officer and completed a distinguished career as Deputy Assistant Director for Domestic Intelligence with the FBI. Pat even became an FBI employee for eighteen months. But alas, a career in law enforcement proved impractical in the real world. She did graduate from the FBI Citizens Academy in 2009.', \"Her career experiences include time as an executive assistant in hospital administration, managing a multi-state telecommunications network for a large company, bank security operations, and computer technology. She became president of her own computer company in 1991 and went to work at the company full time in 1993. She and her husband operated the company until they sold it at the end of 2006.
